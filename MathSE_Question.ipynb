    "I'm Sorry I think the question was vague, because I really wanted to make a wider question but while writing it I focused on the part about periodicity with some big omissions. I fix that now, and I think this answers the title of my question. And I realize it was a dumb question , not only vague. I just didn't took the time to try to answer it myself. Maybe someone can add a better answer after this. \n",
