    " If you play with the construction and the colors $C_n \\equiv n \\pmod{M_c}$ you see that for most random values of $M_c$ you get noisy and difficult to predict patterns in the colors. Logically being M_c=13 in the Fibonacci sequence you get a nice pattern because of how this particular irrational can be approximated as a rational $T_n=F_n/F_{n-1}$. Looking closely on the pattern you realize that doing the 3'd order backward difference the number 13  appears as the first constant sequence. \n",

    "\"This enables the use of precomputation in reconstruction algorithms, improves numerical robustness, and simplifies data management. A crucial insight was that with the right choice of the spoke increment and total number of spokes, the sampling scheme not only approximates the right angle but also steps through all possible angles of the underlying equidistant sampling scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although based on a rational approximation, we show that RAGA sampling preserves all important properties of golden ratio sampling. This was demonstrated by calculating and comparing the SPR values of selected irrational angles with their RAGA approximations. For spokes following the corresponding generalized Fibonacci series the SPR values of both schemes are close to the theoretical optimum of the equidistant angular distribution. For spokes in between elements of the generalized Fibonacci series the periodically changing homogeneity in k-space coverage for small angles leads in both schemes to increased SPR values. The approximation accuracy increases fast with the approximation order. For sampling schemes that fulfill the Nyquist criterion for typical base resolutions, the approximation error is lower than one degree. Double golden ratio angles have very similar SPR behavior to similar golden ratio angles and provide an alternative that can be used to distribute the spokes over the full circle without having to artificially increase the index space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to golden ratio sampling schemes, RAGA sampling schemes repeat after acquiring a finite number of spokes as defined by the approximation order. This avoids the accumulation of numerical errors over multiple repetitions due to floating point arithmetic. Additionally, the sampling scheme and related quantities such as its PSF can be precomputed and reused in the reconstruction, reducing memory requirements and potentially reconstruction time.\"\n",
