    "Disclaimer: This is  a recreational math question from a math hobbyist  looking for guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is TLDR introduction for the question, but the reason is to give context of why I'm looking for guidance and good reads on how to describe some mathematical definitions as periodicity in an extended sense.  \n",

    "\n",
    "I immediately thought I agree, without even  understanding clearly the meaning  in the real world of such a statement. just thought in my infinite ignorance, I agree. That sounds nice. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's what I've been thinking  about monads, trying to understand how just the process of evolving-time could be enough to create geometry and this way creating everything that is observable, expanding from an initial spatial and temporal coordinate and evolving according to  a simple set of initial rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "Math is the best infinite game available for  humans (not only mathematicians), and I had the \"irrational\" impulse of start working on a model of a toy-universe where  math is creating everything using the energy and information associated to the beat of a \"drum\" or the tick of a \"clock\" at the center of coordinates, what in our game  would be \"the center of the universe\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can think of a model of a toy-universe  using a set of initial conditions and simple set of rules that ends up describing a set of orbi-curves able to describe some fundamental geometric shapes flexible enough to create everything else, all monads information being  governed by local phenomena and the timing and syncing governed by a binary clock at the center of the universe. \n",

    "# About why choosing the word Monad for the toy-universe game\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of a monad as a virtual particle, that is able to \"reflect\" or \"refract\" some information with it's own essential bias, a feature that can be seen as a color or an associated symbol  . \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way we can imagine a monad for our experiment is as a musical note able to create in connection with others a geometry that is predictable by our brains, making it more enjoyable. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I think of  monads I think about an \"a-priori-random\"  set of events that leave as a trace of their occurrence a set of \"a-priori-indivisible\" entities that have some information associated to them, and this information can be thought as a biased-reflection of their immediate context and the whole system state, but at the same time these entities have their own essence given  by the \"universe-architect\" at the \"beginning\", being able to position the monad in context with others, in a specific spatial and temporal coordinate, working as some kind of universe-building-celular-automata governed by the simplest central rules (Central binary clock or \"Drum\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "But using Wikipedia we see some of the real meanings of the word:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In philosophy: An ultimate atom, or simple, unextended point; something ultimate and indivisible. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In functional programming: A data type which represents a specific form of computation, along with the operations \"return\" and \"bind\". \n",
    "\n",
    "* In category theory: A monoid object in the category of endo-functors of a fixed category. ¿¿¿What???\n",
    "\n",
    "* Co-monad as  a monad of the opposite category. This makes me think for example \"monads\" 1 with -1 as the main items in the category positive and negative integers, but also as a sense of direction in space like spin. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* For context we should mention Leibniz's \"La Monadologie\" \n",
    "\n",
    "* Leibniz surmised that there are indefinitely many substances individually 'programmed' to act in a predetermined way, each substance being coordinated with all the others. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This is the pre-established harmony which solved the mind-body problem, but at the cost of declaring any interaction between substances a mere appearance.\n",

    "# The clock at the center of the universe\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine a tick of a clock in the center of the toy-universe, that is there from the beginning. Each tick is transmitted to the whole universe through \n",
    "a  time-wave that travels \"instantaneously\" everywhere bringing motion to everything that is being built since the \"Big Drum Celular Automata Process\" started. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why binary counting\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine each monad in the system as being created and transformed by every tick of the clock. This can be thought as some kind of universal digital circuit, where a main clock syncs everything with everything else. In this toy-universe-game the idea is to allow this central clock to provide a geometry where \"reality\" is displayed. \n",
